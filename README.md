# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

## Overview

Commercial banks receive numerous applications for credit cards. These applications can be rejected for various reasons, such as high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming.

This project aims to automate the credit card approval process using machine learning techniques, similar to the systems employed by commercial banks.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a machine learning model to automatically predict credit card approvals.
- Utilized advanced algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Streamlined the application review process, reducing manual effort and errors.

## Features

- **Automated Decision-Making:** Leverages machine learning to evaluate credit card applications efficiently.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Reduces human error and speeds up the approval process.
- **Scalable Solution:** Can be adapted for use by financial institutions of varying sizes.
